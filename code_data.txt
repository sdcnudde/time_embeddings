CODE

1. Sample with productviewsampling.hql (script: time_embeddings/src/hql).


2. Extract viewings from sampled data with time_embeddings/src/ipynb/ExtractViewingData.ipynb. Results in customer_product_date.csv and customer_labels.csv (data on blob sdcsparkrd01).


3. Make CV folds with script time_embeddings/src/ipynb/MakeCrossValidationSplits.ipynb.


4. Make labels for CLTV classification with code time_embeddings/src/ipynb/makeCLTVLabels.ipynb. Results in file labels_cltv.txt (on blob)


5. For MF:

- Convert customer_product_date.csv to Rating data (script: time_embeddings/src/ipynb/TransformViewsToMFFormat.ipynb). Results in customer_product_rating.csv (data on blob sdcspardrd01).


- Do MF (script: time_embeddings/src/ipynb/DoMF.ipynb). Results in user embeddings (embeddings on blob sdcsparkrd01 in mf_2, mf_4, â€¦, mf_512).


- Evaluate vectors on extrinsic characteristics (script: time_embeddings/src/ipynb/evaluateMFEmbeddings.ipynb)


6. For standard W2V:

- Convert customer_product_date.csv to sentence file with script time_embeddings/src/ipynb/MakeSentenceFileSample.ipynb. Results in customer_sentences2.txt and dates2_sentences.csv (on USB).


- Do W2V with script time_embeddings/src/python/word2vec.py. Results in embeddings w2v_output_dim_*_wdw_*_iter_*_skip_*.txt.

- Evaluate vectors on extrinsic characteristics (script: time_embeddings/src/ipynb/evaluateEmbeddingsW2V.ipynb)


7. For customized W2V with time:

- Use dates2_sentences.csv and customer_sentence2.txt.

- Use package gensim_cust (on blob sdcsparkrd01) with script time_embeddings/src/python/word2vec_time.py.
